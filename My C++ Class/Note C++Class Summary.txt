Scope is the region of code that has access to an element;
C++ function are usually split to make code more modular
{
	The declaration in header file (.hpp)
	The definition in another .cpp file
}
//Program with multiple .cpp files need to be linked at compile time
// Header files must be included in the file with main():
#include "fns.hpp"
//Default argrument can be add in the parameter over the header files
// Overload funtions so that they can handle multiple type of agrument data type
// Template enables function to behave the same with different datatypes of parameters;

Classes are user_defined types.
Obtect are instances of classes.
Class member are the data attributes and function inside of a class.
Creating a new object from class is called instantiation.
